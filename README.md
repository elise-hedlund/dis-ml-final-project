Elise Hedlund, Ethan Ernst, & Leonard Mayorga

For our final project, we conducted an analysis using binary classification with multiple machine learning models on a hotel reservations dataset. Our report detailing our work and conclusions can be viewed as a pdf. Our code can be run via the included ipynb file. Our dataset is linked in the blog post and also included as a csv in this repository.
