Elise Hedlund, Ethan Ernst, & Leonard Mayorga

For our final project, we conducted an analysis using binary classification with multiple machine learning models on a hotel reservations dataset. Our report detailing our work and conclusions can be viewed as a [pdf](Hotel%20Reservation%20Classification%20-%20Report.pdf). Our code can be run via the included ipynb file. Our dataset is [linked](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset) in the blog post and also included as a csv in this repository.
